**Why adding Facebook Authentication into your app will benefit you and your users?**

  - **Improve conversions:** Help people log into your app quickly without having to register a new user and remember another username and password.
  - **One login across every device:** Make it easy for people to log in and access their info across multiple platforms and devices.
  - **Build a trusted relationship:** Give people control over the info they share with your app.
  - **Access profile info:** like picture, gender, age, name, without having to ask for it.

## Facebook Authentication

There are different ways to integrate Facebook authentication into your Ionic app. However, only the way covered in this post uses the native approach which uses Facebook app to perform the login instead of opening a popup requesting users to enter their credentials to login to Facebook before granting access to your app.

What does this mean? That if you chose to integrate other libraries (some of them mentioned below), your users will end up having an awful user experience as they will be prompted to enter their Facebook username and password each time your app requests authorization from Facebook.
Using the native approach we cover in this post, if users have the Facebook app installed on their devices, the authorization flow will be unobtrusive without requiring users to perform unnecessary extra steps.

This comparison illustrates the difference mentioned above:
